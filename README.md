#This project focuses on detecting anomalies in Bitcoin transaction data using Machine Learning techniques.
#The goal is to identify unusual transaction patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity, network attacks, or abnormal market behavior.
#By leveraging unsupervised learning methods like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders, the model learns the normal behavior of Bitcoin transactions and flags deviations that could signify anomalies.
